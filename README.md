This app is still underdevelopment! Check back later.

This is a small app commissioned by the MyChoice. It allows a user to choose their insurer and the date the signed up with them. Based on this data, the app will calculate how much their rate increased since they've been with their insurer. The data goes back to 2018 and is publicly available information. 

Next steps will be to show the user comparable rate increases for this time frame.
