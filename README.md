# rate-increase-calculator

This is a small app commissioned by the MyChoice. It allows a user to choose their insurer and the date the signed up with them. Based on this data, the app will calculate how much their insurance provider's rates have changed since they've been with their insurer. This does not necessarily reflect the user's increase, as insurance rates are based on a number of factors, but it does give the user a good idea of how muhc their provider altered their rates in comparison to other providers. The data goes back to 2018 and is publicly available information.
